It is a demo application which allows users to create posts, view posts, and also load the details of a post (Currently in progress), with the help of routing.
It was built to understand React better, how to work with props, components, state, Modals wrapping components, Loaders, Hooks and how to add Routing to support multi-page experience while still being a single page Applicaition. 

React Router helps with data loading and data submission. 
How to make component code leaner. 

What it does?
Once you clone it on your local, it will open a single page web app hosted on 80 port. It shows a simple posting action. 
The project enables users to post a new "post", and display the data on theat page. 
I used a simple backend to store the posts.json and fetch them as and when necessary. 
In short, it is a simple project to understand how to connect UI components with your backend data, send and receive api requests on the server.

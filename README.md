This is a miniature version of Twitter. It is a simple project to understand React the usage of components, Modals wrapping features, Loaders, Hooks by implementing them.  

What it does?
Once you clone it on your local, it will open a single page web app hosted on 80 port. It shows a simple posting action. 
The project enables users to post a new "post", and display the data on theat page. 
I used a simple backend to store the posts.json and fetch them as and when necessary. 
In short, it is a simple project to understand how to connect UI components with your backend data, send and receive api requests on the server. 




Installations:
You can use Vite to create React App. 

# React + Vite

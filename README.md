It is a demo application which allows users to 
1. Create posts
2. View posts
3. Load the details of a post (Currently in progress), with the help of dynamic routing.
   
It was built to solidify React Essentials:
1. Props
2. Components
3. State management
4. Modals wrapping components
5. Loaders
6. Hooks
7. How to work with routing to support multi-page experience while still being a single page Applicaition. 

There has also been attempt to keep the code leaner and follow best practices, while there is always room for improvement. 

Functionality
After cloning it to your system, the project will open a single page web app. It displays a simple posting action. 
The project enables users to post a new "post", and display the data on that page. The data is fetched from backend and then displayed.

In short, it is a simple project to understand how to connect UI components with your backend data, send and receive api requests on the server.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
